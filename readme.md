**Thesis template**

> A latex thesis template for my students

# Description

This is a fully working latex template which tries to conform by the
Politecnico di Milano standards for master thesis's production.

In principle, you shouldn't need anything else for running it besides
`gnu make` and `pdflatex`.

# Prompts

The template is characterized by prompts (questions) that should help
you in deciding what to put in each chapter and sections.

> Note for my students: the structure presented in the thesis is
> somewhat rigid for you, and any change to it should be discussed with
> me.
