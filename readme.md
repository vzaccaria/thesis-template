> Thesis template for my students

# Description

This is a fully working latex template which tries to conform by the
Politecnico di Milano standards for master thesis's production.

In principle, you shouldn't need anything else for running it besides
`gnu make` and `pdflatex`.

# Prompts

The template is characterized by prompt questions that should help you
in deciding what to put in each chapter and sections.

> Note for my students: these are of fundamental importance for me
